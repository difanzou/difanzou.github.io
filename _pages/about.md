About me
======
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). My research interests fall in developing **machine learning algorithms** in various related fields including adversarial learning, learning to learn, optimization and self-supervised learning. Here is my latest [Curriculum Vitae](/files/CV_Yuanhao.pdf). 

I finished my bachelor of engineering at Zhejiang University. I previously worked as a research intern of the City Brain Research advised by [Prof. Zhenhui Jessie Li](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jessieli) in 2019. Before that, I was a research intern at DiDi AI Labs in Beijing and my mentor was [Prof. Yan Liu](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/). I was also a research assistant of [Prof. Guanding Yu's](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yuguanding) group in 2017.
